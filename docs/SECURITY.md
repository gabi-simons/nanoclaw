# NanoClaw Security Model

## Trust Model

| Entity | Trust Level | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Main group | Trusted | Private self-chat, admin control |
| Non-main groups | Untrusted | Other users may be malicious |
| Container agents | Sandboxed | Isolated execution environment |
| WhatsApp messages | User input | Potential prompt injection |

## Security Boundaries

### 1. Container Isolation (Primary Boundary)

Agents execute in containers (lightweight Linux VMs), providing:
- **Process isolation** - Container processes cannot affect the host
- **Filesystem isolation** - Only explicitly mounted directories are visible
- **Non-root execution** - Runs as unprivileged `node` user (uid 1000) via `gosu`
- **Ephemeral containers** - Fresh environment per invocation (`--rm`)
- **Environment isolation** - Layered defense to protect credentials from agent-accessible paths

This is the primary security boundary. Rather than relying on application-level permission checks, the attack surface is limited by what's mounted.

#### Environment Boundary Layers

Credentials (API keys) must be available to the SDK for authentication but should not be discoverable by agent-executed commands. The following layers work together:

1. **Clean process environment** (`env -i`) — The entrypoint starts the node process with a stripped environment containing only safe vars (PATH, HOME, TZ, etc.). No secrets appear in `/proc/<pid>/environ`.

2. **Privilege drop** (`gosu`) — The entrypoint drops to an unprivileged user for the node process, ensuring non-root execution.

3. **Bash hook guard** — A PreToolUse hook blocks commands that pattern-match against `/proc/*/environ`, `ps -e`, and similar process inspection commands. This is a deterrent, not a hard boundary.

4. **Environment variable stripping** (`unset`) — Every Bash command is prefixed with `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ...` to remove secrets from the shell session's environment.

> **Known limitation:** The SDK passes credentials via the `env` option to tool subprocesses. A subprocess's `/proc/self/environ` may still contain the API key at exec time. The hook layer blocks common read patterns, but a determined actor with shell access could bypass string matching. This is an upstream SDK constraint — true credential isolation requires the SDK to separate authentication credentials from the tool execution environment.

### 2. Mount Security

**External Allowlist** - Mount permissions stored at `~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json`, which is:
- Outside project root
- Never mounted into containers
- Cannot be modified by agents

**Default Blocked Patterns:**
```
.ssh, .gnupg, .aws, .azure, .gcloud, .kube, .docker,
credentials, .env, .netrc, .npmrc, id_rsa, id_ed25519,
private_key, .secret
```

**Protections:**
- Symlink resolution before validation (prevents traversal attacks)
- Container path validation (rejects `..` and absolute paths)
- `nonMainReadOnly` option forces read-only for non-main groups

**Read-Only Project Root:**

The main group's project root is mounted read-only. Writable paths the agent needs (group folder, IPC, `.claude/`) are mounted separately. This prevents the agent from modifying host application code (`src/`, `dist/`, `package.json`, etc.) which would bypass the sandbox entirely on next restart.

### 3. Session Isolation

Each group has isolated Claude sessions at `data/sessions/{group}/.claude/`:
- Groups cannot see other groups' conversation history
- Session data includes full message history and file contents read
- Prevents cross-group information disclosure

### 4. IPC Authorization

Messages and task operations are verified against group identity:

| Operation | Main Group | Non-Main Group |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Send message to own chat | ✓ | ✓ |
| Send message to other chats | ✓ | ✗ |
| Schedule task for self | ✓ | ✓ |
| Schedule task for others | ✓ | ✗ |
| View all tasks | ✓ | Own only |
| Manage other groups | ✓ | ✗ |

### 5. Credential Handling

**Mounted Credentials:**
- Claude auth tokens (filtered from `.env`, read-only)

**NOT Mounted:**
- WhatsApp session (`store/auth/`) - host only
- Mount allowlist - external, never mounted
- Any credentials matching blocked patterns

**Credential Filtering:**
Only these environment variables are exposed to containers:
```typescript
const allowedVars = ['CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN', 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'];
```

> **Note:** Anthropic credentials are passed to the SDK for authentication. The container entrypoint uses `env -i` and privilege separation to prevent these from appearing in inspectable process environments. However, the SDK passes them to tool subprocesses internally. See "Environment Boundary Layers" above for the full defense-in-depth approach and known limitations.

## Privilege Comparison

| Capability | Main Group | Non-Main Group |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| Project root access | `/workspace/project` (ro) | None |
| Group folder | `/workspace/group` (rw) | `/workspace/group` (rw) |
| Global memory | Implicit via project | `/workspace/global` (ro) |
| Additional mounts | Configurable | Read-only unless allowed |
| Network access | Unrestricted | Unrestricted |
| MCP tools | All | All |
